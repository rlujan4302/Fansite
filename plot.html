The Enclave is the biggest army out there second the bos. When they invade your dad sacrificing himself leaves you the chance to leave to the bos base. There with doctor li's influence there you gather their support to take back the purifier. However not before you meet president Eden the leader of the enclave who wants you to infect the water with FFV poison that would kill all radiation affected human beings basically everyone. After you go back to the Bos and go out on the enclave with Bos behind you with liberty prime. As you make it to the purifier control room you find out whoever activates it will die by intense radiation leakage.
